                      <h2>To Parlay or not to Parlay?</h2>
                      <p>You've decided that two teams are going to beat the spread. Should you bet a parlay or place two separate bets?</p>
                      <p>If each bet is a bad bet then a parlay only makes the bet worse, and if each bet is a good bet then a parlay makes the bet better. However, if you are placing a bet then it is probably about even. In this case, the choice of parlay or not is largely unimportant unless the two games are correlated.</p>
                      <p>Let's consider the expected payout of a straight bet versus a parlay. Assume Arizona and Chicago are both slight underdogs so a victory simply doubles your money. Then a parlay would quadruple your money if both teams win! If Arizona and Chicago both independently win half of the time then the straight bet will net you a dollar 1/4 of the time, lose you a dollar 1/4 of the time, and break even the other half of the time. A parlay would net 3 dollars 1/4 of the time and lose a dollar the other 3/4 of the time. Thus in the long run either bet will not be a winner or a loser.</p>
                      <p>What if the teams do not win exactly half of the time? If either team wins less than half of the time then you shouldn't be betting on them at these odds. However, the parlay will deplete your account faster.


                      <h2>What about bankroll management?</h2>
                      <p>A successful betting strategy requires more than comparing expected payouts. Bankroll management is important, assuming your bankroll is not infinite. Imagine someone offers you 2-1 odds (you get $3 back for a successful $1 bet) on heads coming up on a coin flip. They will let you repeat up to ten times. How much should you bet? The odds are very good so you should really get some of the action. Betting your entire life savings each time offers the best expected return. If you get heads each time you will have 3^10 times your life savings. And this outcome occurs 1/2^10 times so the expected return is that you will have more than 56 times your life savings! But almost every time you will end up with nothing. It is probably smarter to place smaller bets so that you are much more likely to make some money even if the expected return is smaller.</p>
                      <p>Bankroll management often means reducing the expected return by a small amount to decrease the risk even more. Parlays are riskier than straight bets so all else being equal the straight bet is the smart bet. If you bet on enough games then the higher expected value of a parlay can be incorporated into a bankroll strategy. </p>


                      <h2>Why are some parlays better than others?</h2>
                      <p>The NFL is interconnected enough that it is impossible to judge the quality of any team without assuming information about the rest of the league. In particular when two teams play each other it is somewhat easy to determine which team is better, but it is much harder to determine whether both teams are good or both teams are bad. Thus their rankings will be intertwined. If one of these teams is later upset then it is more likely that the other team is worse than expected as well. Hence betting on a parlay with both teams can provide better odds than two individual bets.</p>
                      <p>Consider a league with 4 teams: Arizona, Baltimore, Chicago, and Detroit. There are 4 choices for which team is the best, and then 3 choices for second best, and then 2 choices for third best, and then there is only 1 choice left for the worst team. Thus there are 24 possible rankings of these 4 teams. Arizona is better than Baltimore is better than Chicago is better than Detroit, or Detroit is better than Chicago is better than Baltimore is better than Arizona, or any of the other 22 similar rankings.  It is an expansion league and we have no information about the teams so each of these rankings is equally likely.</p>
                      <p>Pretend that the league removes all randomness so the better team always wins. In week 1, Arizona beats Baltimore and Chicago beats Detroit. We want to bet on week 2 games. What we want to do is determine which of the 24 possible rankings is the correct ranking. We only know two outcomes so we cannot eliminate every scenario, but let's see how much we can eliminate. </p>
                      <p>Those are all 24 possibilities, but we can eliminate all of the rows where Baltimore is better than Arizona because we know that Arizona beat Baltimore. </p>
                      <p>That one game eliminates half of the possibilities. Since we didn't know anything about the teams before the game it makes sense that half of the rankings would have Baltimore better than Arizona. Similarly, half of the remaining rankings should have Detroit better than Chicago. The following table lists all 12 remaining rankings with a line through each row where Detroit is better than Chicago. We will eliminate these rows since Chicago beat Detroit in week 1. </p>
                      <p>After week 1 only 6 possible rankings remain. In week 2, Arizona plays Chicago and Baltimore plays Detroit. Let's look at the table below to examine our possibilities. The two columns on the right indicate whether or not Arizona (A) will beat Chicago (C) and whether or not Baltimore (B) will beat Detroit (D). </p>
                      <p>Now we are ready to place some bets. The probability that Arizona beats Chicago is 50%. Thus a sportsbook should put the odds of Arizona winning around -110. So placing a $110 bet on Arizona would pay out $210 if they win. The other game is also a tossup so every team should have odds of -110. The sportsbook will take their cut, but picking the correct team should almost double your bet.</p>
                      <p>The general method a sportsbook uses to compute parlay odds is to multiply the odds of each outcome. If the odds of picking each game correctly are 50% then the odds of picking both games will be 25%. A sportsbook that doesn't take a cut would place the parlay odds at +300 so a $100 bet would payout $400 if both teams win. In reality the odds are often +260 so the payout is $360.</p>
                      <p>So what are the actual probabilities of a parlay paying out? We can look at our table and see which rows payout for which bets. The last 4 columns are the outcomes of each parlay. For example the A and B column is the outcome of a parlay on Arizona and Baltimore to win.</p>
                      <p>The Arizona and Baltimore parlay wins 2 out of 6 times. Each of the 6 rankings is equally likely with the information from week 1 so this parlay will payout 1/3 of the time. Since we get $360 for each win our expected return is $360/3 which is $120. Our bet was only $100 so we actually have a positive expected return from the parlay. We knew no more information than the sportsbook about the outcomes, but were able to get an edge. Betting on Arizona and Detroit, however, would be a terrible bet as we only win 1/6 of the time for an expected payout of $60 on a $100 bet. Of the four parlays, betting on Arizona and Baltimore to win and also betting the opposite that Chicago and Detroit win would mean one of the parlays would payout 2/3 of the time. Thus $200 would become $360 with probability 2/3.</p>
                      <p>To continue this theorectical scenario let's examine what would happen if week 2 had featured Arizona playing Detroit and Baltimore playing Chicago. Week 1 was the same so we still have the same 6 possible rankings. Our new possibilities would look like this:</p>
                      <p> With the week 1 winners playing the week 1 losers the odds on both games have changed. Now Arizona and Chicago each have a 5/6 chance of winning. Pretending the sportsbook is not seeking a cut, the odds would be +500 for Baltimore so a $100 bet would payout $600. And the odds for Arizona would be -500 so a $500 bet would payout $600.</p>
                      <p>A parlay on Arizona and Baltimore would be determined by multiplying the odds of each team winning so 1/6*5/6, which is 5/36. A sportsbook would payout $360 on a $50 parlay bet if they had fair odds so let's give them a cut of 10% so they payout $324 on a $50 bet on Arizona and Baltimore. What is the probability that both teams win? Looking at the above table there is only one row where Baltimore wins and Arizona also wins in this case so the odds of the parlay are 1/6. Thus the sportsbook would owe us $324 about 1/6 times for an expected payout of $54 on a $50 bet.</p>
                      <p>So there are theoretical scenarios where beating the sportsbook is possible without knowing anything extra about the teams. All of the above make good exercises for a combinatorics or proabability classroom, but what about in real life? First of all, there is too much randomness to eliminate any possible rankings. But maybe we can still learn enough to get an edge on the sportsbook.</p>

                      <h2>Are some parlays easy money?</h2>
                      <p>Let's redo the above example, but assume that sometimes the superior team loses to an inferior foe. We will use ELO ratings to make probabilities easy to compute. We have the same 4 teams that we know nothing about except that they have different abilities. The best team has an ELO rating of 1575, the second best a rating of 1525, the third best a rating of 1475, and the worst has a rating of 1425. If you don't care to learn more about ELO ratings then all you need to know is that the best team has a 57.1% chance of beating the second best team, a 64.0% chance of beating the third best, and a 70.3% chance of beating the worst team. Similarly, the second best team has a 57.1% chance of beating the third best team and a 64.0% chance of beating the worst team. The third best team has a 57.1% chance of beating the worst team. We still do not know which teams are better than other teams, and so we need to determine the probability of each possible ranking.</p>
                      <p>Before week 1 we know nothing about the teams so each of the 24 possible rankings is equally likely to occur. But what happens after Arizona beats Baltimore in week 1. We cannot eliminate the possibility that Baltimore is better than Arizona, but we do want to make consider those rankings as less likely to occur since Arizona is probably better than Baltimore. Given that Arizona beat Baltimore, what is the probability that Arizona is better than Baltimore?</p>
                      <p>We need to know a little bit about conditional probabilities. P(A|B) is notation for the probability that event A happens given that event B happened. We know that B happened so if A happens that means that A and B occured. So we want the probability of A and B occuring. But we only care about situations where B happened so we divide the probability of both by the probability that B happened. Thus P(A|B)=P(A and B)/P(B). Simlarly,  P(B|A)=P(A and B)/P(A) so multiplying by P(A) we get that P(A and B)=P(B|A)*P(A). We can plug this equality into the previous to yield P(A|B)=P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B).</p>
                      <p>So how does P(A|B)=P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B) relate to our scenario. We want to probability that Arizona is better than Baltimore given that Arizona beat Baltimore. Thus we want to compute P(Arizona better than Baltimore | Arizona beat Baltimore). We know this probability will equal P(Arizona beat Baltimore | Arizona better than Baltimore)*P(Arizona is better than Baltimore)/P(Arizona beat Baltimore).</p>
                      <p>Unfortunately it does matter whether Arizona is a lot better than Baltimore or just a little bit better so we will break up our question into three parts. First, what is the probability that Arizona is 1 position better than Baltimore? That is, what is the probability that Arizona is best while Baltimore is second best or Arizona is second best and Baltimore third best or Arizona is third best and Baltimore is the worst? We want to compute P(Arizona beat Baltimore | Arizona 1 spot better than Baltimore)*P(Arizona is 1 spot better than Baltimore)/P(Arizona beat Baltimore).</p>
                      <p>First, what is P(Arizona beat Baltimore | Arizona 1 spot better than Baltimore)? We computed this earlier as 57.1% based on the difference in ELO. What is P(Arizona is 1 spot better than Baltimore)? Here we use the table. Before the game we assumed that each ranking is equally likely so we count how many of the 24 have Arizona 1 spot better than Baltimore.</p>
                      <p>We are left with 6 rankings where Arizona is exactly 1 spot better than Baltimore so P(Arizona is 1 spot better than Baltimore)=1/4. What is P(Arizona beat Baltimore)? Before the game we didn't know anything about the teams so the probability was 50%. You could compute the probabilty of the game in each row and compute the average, but it will be 50%.</p>
                      <p>We know each of the 3 parts so all that remains is combining them to compute P(Arizona better than Baltimore | Arizona beat Baltimore)=57.1%*25%/50%=28.55%. There are 6 rows where Arizona is one spot better than Baltimore and each is equally likely to occur so each possibility occurs 4.76% of the time.</p>
                      <p>We repeat the same type of computation to determine the proabilities that Arizona is 2 or 3 spots better than Baltimore and that Arizona is 1, 2, or 3 spots worse than Baltimore. We arrive at the following table:</p>
                      <p>Now is where things gets complicated. We want to repeat the same computations to account for Chicago beating Detroit. Except now each ranking has different probabilities to begin with. So we will perform our computations for every possible ranking. So we compute P(1st row is correct | Chicago beat Detroit) with the underlying knowledge that Arizona beat Baltimore. We know that P(1st row is correct | Chicago beat Detroit)=P(Chicago beat Detroit | 1st row is correct)*P(1st row is correct)/P(Chicago beat Detroit). For all of these computations, P(Chicago beat Detroit)=.5 since we do not know anything about the two teams yet. You could do the computation yourself by computing the probability of Chicago victory in each scenario and multiplying by the probability of that scenario and adding them all up. For each computation the P(some row is correct) part is the last column of the above table so P(1st row is correct)=4.76% and P(3rd row is correct)=5.33%. Then P(Chicago beat Detroit | some row is correct) is determined by looking at that row to see how Chicago and Detroit compare and getting the correct win percentage. So in the 1st row, Chicago is 1 spot better than Detroit so the probability is 57.1%.</p>
                      <p>Now it time to make our bets. We know the probability that each ranking is correct. Suppose that Arizona plays Chicago and Baltimore plays Detroit. For each row we can compute the probability of each outcome so that we can compute the odds a sportsbook will post. We use our ELO differences to compute each probability with the assumption that a particular row is correct. So in row 1, the probability ofArizona beating Chicago is 64.0% since Arizona is two spots ahead. We take the probability of each outcome multiplied by the probability of that row being correct and add them up to get the probability of victory.</p>
                      <p>When we add up all of the probabilities we get the probability of Arizona beating Chicago to be 50%. That makes sense because there is really no reason to expect either team to be better than the other based on what we know. And the same is true for Baltimore beating Detroit. The expected parlay odds for Arizona and Baltimore winning without a cut for the sportsbook would be +300 again. What are the computed odds that Arizona and Baltimore both win? 25.05%. So these two events are not independent, but you would need to find a very generous bookie to make this edge profitable.</p>
                      <p>Or if you have other information that suggests Arizona and Baltimore are better than the sportsbooks think, then turning a straight bet into a parlay can be worthwhile. The good news is that there is an edge to exploit. We just need to hope that there is some way to magnify that advantage by a large multiple. We are basing our strategy on two games so the randomness is bound to have too much of an impact. After several more games the advantage should increase, but then the computations become more involved. Trying to rank all 32 NFL teams with this method requires computing 32! probabilities so we will need to simplify the process.</p>
