											<h1>MLB Sudoku</h1>
											<p>More Than Twice the Fun!</p>
										</header>
										<p>MLB Sudoku has the same rules as regular sudoku except each cell has two pieces of information. Your goal is to arrange the lineups so that no row, column, or 3x3 block has two players with the same position or team.</p>
										<p>You can try to fill in all of the positions without worrying about the teams. And try to fill in all of the teams without worrying about the positions. In these cases you are simply completing two sudokus in the same puzzle and can use the exact strategies you normally use.</p>
										<p>However, there is one extra source of strategy. Each position-team pair is used exactly once so if you get stuck then you can use the information simultaneously. If you know a cell is a catcher and you know what team the other 8 catchers play for then you can deduce the team of the final catcher. There are many more avenues for deducing the answer so put on your creative and logical hats and have some fun!</p>
										<p>Puzzles range from easy puzzles that any sudokuer can solve to difficult puzzles that will take some time to crack.</p>

					                    <p>Do you know what teams every player has played for?</p>
					                    <p>These puzzles require you to arrange players in a square of varying dimensions. Each row and column (and sometimes diagonal) must contain players that played for the same team. If Barry Bonds is in the top left cell then every player in the top row must have played for the Pirates and each player in the left column must have played for the Giants, or vice versa.</p>
					                    <p>Solving each puzzle requires you to know what teams everyone played for and use some logic to determine which teams go in which rows and columns. There are a variety of puzzles from 3x3 puzzles that might be done quickly to 7x7 puzzles that could take days of frustration to figure out.</p>
