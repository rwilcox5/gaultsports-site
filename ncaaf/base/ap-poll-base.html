                    <p>Do you feel like voters rank some teams too high or low every week?</p>
                    <p>What if there was a way to adjust for the natural biases of voters to create a more accurate ranking? The TripleLog poll uses the same AP voters, but if a voter consistently misranks a particular team or conference then their vote does not count as heavily.</p>
                    <p>The best pollsters should have the most say, so we track every game to see who is the best overall, for each conference, and for each team. Biases are adjusted and bad voters are largely ignored.</p>
                    <p> The votes are weighted so that the difference in points for each team represents an approximation of the point spread between the teams on a neutral field. If the top ranked team has a score of 99.4 and the second ranked team has a score of 97.8 then the TripleLog estimate is that the top ranked team would win by 1.6 points in a game at a neutral site. </p>
